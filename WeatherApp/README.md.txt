# Weather App

## Overview
A simple Apache Cordova app using an API call to OWM (Open Weather Maps). 
This can accept US zipcodes and returns weather data for the specified area.

## Future Plans
- I plan to change the API to a UK weather resource and make it searchable by placename and/or postcode.
- The UI has only had minimal work on it so far but will be further developed.
- I may experiment with background images that change depending on the type of weather that is occurring.
